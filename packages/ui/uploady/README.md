# Uploady

This is the main UI package. Its role is to initialize and expose the [uploader](../../core/uploader) functionality.
It contains the Provider that all other UI packages rely on.

It provides multiple hooks that enable more advanced features and data for client apps.


## Installation

```shell
#Yarn: 
   $ yarn add @rpldy/uploady

#NPM:
   $ npm i @rpldy/uploady
```

## Example

To be able to use one of the [UI Components](../../../README.md#ui-packages) or one of the hooks, you need to wrap them with <Uploady>.
This will give them access to the UploadyContext.

```javascript

import Uploady from "@rpldy/uploady";

const App = () => (<Uploady
    multiple
    grouped
    maxGroupSize={2}
    method="PUT"
    destination={{url: "https://my-server", headers: {"x-custom": "123"}}}>

    <RestOfMyApp/>
</Uploady>)

```

## Context

When working in React, The UploadyContext is the API provider for the uploader mechanism.
It wraps the uploader and exposes everything the app using it needs.

```javascript
import React, { useContext, useCallback } from "react";
import Uploady, { UploadyContext } from "@rpldy/uploady";

const MyComponent = () => { 
    const uploady = useContext(UploadyContext);

    const onClick = useCallback(()=> {
            uploady.showFileUpload();
        });

    return <button onClick={onClick}>Custom Upload Button</button>
}

const App = () => (<Uploady>
    <MyComponent/>
</Uploady>);

```

### UploadyContext API

#### showFileUpload 

_(?UploadOptions) => void_
    
Show the native file selection dialog. Optionally Pass options as a parameter to override options set as props on the <Uploady/> component. 

#### upload 

_(files: UploadInfo | UploadInfo[], addOptions: ?UploadOptions) => void_

Upload file(s). Optionally Pass options as the second parameter to override options set as props on the <Uploady/> component.

#### processPending

_(uploadOptions?: UploadOptions) => void_

Start uploading batches that were added with autoUpload = false

Upload Options can be added here to be (deep) merged with the options the batch(es) was added with.
    
#### setOptions 

_(UploadOptions) => void_
    
Update the uploader instance with different options than the ones used to initialize
    
#### getOptions 

_() => UploadOptions_

get the current options used by the uploader

#### getExtension 

_(name: any) => ?Object_
    
get an extension registered by that name (through an enhancer)
 
#### abort

_(id?: string) => void_

abort all files being uploaded or a single item by its ID
   
#### abortBatch 

_(id: string) => void_
            
abort a specific batch by its ID

#### on 

_(name: any, cb: EventCallback) => OffMethod_

register for an [event](../../core/uploader/README.md#events)
 
#### once 

_(name: any, cb: EventCallback) => OffMethod_
 
register once for an [event](../../core/uploader/README.md#events)
    
#### off

_(name: any, cb?: EventCallback) => void_

unregister from an events

    const MyComponent = () => {
        useBatchStartListener((batch) => {
            console.log(`batch ${batch.id} started uploading`);  
        });

        //or scoped:
        useBatchStartListener((batch) => {
            console.log(`batch ${batch.id} started uploading`);  
        }, "b-123");
        //...    
    };
```

Called every time progress data is received from the upload request(s)

> This event can be scoped to a specific batch by passing the batch id as a second parameter

```javascript
    import { useBatchProgressListener } from "@rpldy/uploady";

   const MyComponent = () => {
        const batch = useBatchProgressListener((batch) => {});
    
        console.log(`batch ${batch.id} is ${batch.completed}% done and ${batch.loaded} bytes uploaded`)

       //...

```javascript
    import { useItemProgressListener } from "@rpldy/uploady";

    const MyComponent = () => {
        const item = useItemProgressListener((item) => {
        	//callback is optional for this hook
        });

        });

        //...    
    };

        });

        //...    
    };
``` 

### useRequestPreSend (event hook)

Called before a group of items is going to be uploaded
Group will contain a single item unless "grouped" option is set to true.

Handler receives the item(s) in the group and the upload options that were used.
The handler can change data inside the items and in the options by returning different data than received.
See simple example below or this more detailed [guide](../../../guides/DynamicParameters.md).

> This event is _[cancellable](../../core/uploader/README.md#cancellable-events)_

```javascript
    import { useRequestPreSend } from "@rpldy/uploady";

    const MyComponent = () => {
        useRequestPreSend(({ items, options }) => {        	
            let method = options.method;

            if (options.destination.url.startsWith("https://put-server")) {
                method = "PUT";
            }            

            return {
                options: { method } //will be merged with the rest of the options 
            };  
        });

        //...    
    };
``` 
    

#### useUploadyContext

Shortcut hook to get the [Uploady Context](#context) instance

> Will throw in case its used outside of <Uploady> render tree

```javascript
    import { uploadyContext } from "@rpldy/uploady";

    const MyComponent = () => {
        const uploadyContext = useUploadyContext();
        
        const onClick = () => {
            uploadyContext.showFileUpload();
        }

        //...       
    };

    const App = () => (
        <Uploady destination={{...}}>
            <MyComponent/>
        </Uploady>
    );
```

### useUploadOptions

Shortcut hook to set/get upload options. 

```javascript
    import { useUploadOptions } from "@rpldy/uploady";

    const MyComponent = () => {
        const options = useUploadOptions({grouped: true, maxGroupSize: 3});
        
        //...       
    };
```
        
### useAbortItem

Returns abort item method 

```javascript
    import { useAbortItem } from "@rpldy/uploady";
    
const MyComponent = () => {
        const abortItem = useAbortItem();
        
        return <button onClick={() => abortItem("i-123")}>Abort Item</button>       
    };
```

### useAbortBatch

Returns abort batch method
   
```javascript
    import { useAbortBatch } from "@rpldy/uploady";
    
    const MyComponent = () => {
        const abortBatch = useAbortBatch();
        
        return <button onClick={() => abortBatch("b-123")}>Abort Batch</button>       
    };
```

### useAbortAll        

Returns abort all method
       
```javascript
  import { useAbortAll } from "@rpldy/uploady";
  
  const MyComponent = () => {
      const abortAll = useAbortAll();
      
      return <button onClick={() => abortAll()}>Abort All</button>       
  };
```      
        
### useFileInput

When customInput prop is set to true. Uploady will not create its own file input element.
In this case, Uploady will wait for a ref to an existing input.

The way you pass in your own input element is by using this hook.

In case Uploady wasn't provided with a destination prop or if it doesn't have a URL property, 
Uploady will check whether the input resides in a form. It will then use the form's action and method to set the upload endpoint and method.
 
> In case the form's attributes were used for the upload destination, updating the form's attributes dynamically won't affect the uploader configuration once it was set.
 
```javascript
import Uploady, { useFileInput } from "@rpldy/uploady";
import UploadButton from "@rpldy/upload-button";

const MyForm = () => {
    const inputRef = useRef();
    useFileInput(inputRef);

    return <form action="/upload" method="POST">
        <input type="file" name="testFile" style={{ display: "none" }} ref={inputRef}/>
    </form>;
};

export const WithCustomFileInputAndForm = () => {
    return <section>
        <Uploady
            debug
            customInput
        >
            <MyForm />
            <UploadButton/>
        </Uploady>
    </section>
};

```

## HOCs

### withRequestPreSendUpdate

HOC to enable components to interact with the upload data and options just-in-time before the request is sent.
This is a hatch point to introduce custom logic that may affect the upload data.

A good example use-case for this is applying [crop](../../../guides/Crop.md) to selected image before it is uploaded.

When rendering the result of the HOC, the id of the batch item to handle must be in the props. 
This to ensure the HOC only re-renders for a specific item and not for all.

```javascript
    import React, { useState, useCallback } from "react";
    import Cropper from "react-easy-crop";
	import Uploady, { withRequestPreSendUpdate } from "@rpldy/uploady";
    import cropImage from "./my-image-crop-code";

    const ItemCrop = withRequestPreSendUpdate((props) => {
        const [crop, setCrop] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });
        const [cropPixels, setCropPixels] = useState(null);
        const { url, updateRequest, requestData } = props;
         
        const onUploadCrop = useCallback(async() => {
            if (updateRequest && cropPixels) {
                //replace the file data with the cropped result
                requestData.items[0].file = await cropImage(url, requestData.items[0].file, cropPixels);
                //resume the upload flow with the updated file data			    
                updateRequest({ items: requestData.items });
            }
        }, [url, requestData, updateRequest, cropPixels]);
    
        const onCropComplete = useCallback((croppedArea, croppedAreaPixels) => {
            setCropPixels(croppedAreaPixels);
        }, []);

        return <>            
            <Cropper
                image={url}
                crop={crop}
                onCropChange={setCrop}
                onCropComplete={onCropComplete}
            />           
            <button style={{ display: updateRequest && cropPixels ? "block" : "none" }}
                    onClick={onUploadCrop}>
                Upload Cropped
            </button>
        </>;
    });

    const MyApp = () => {
        return <Uploady destination={{url: "my-server.com/upload"}}>
            <ItemCrop id="batch-item-1" />
        </Uploady>
    }
```
