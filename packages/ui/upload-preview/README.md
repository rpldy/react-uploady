## Usage

```javascript
import React from "react";
import Uploady from "@rpldy/uploady";
import UploadPreview from "@rpldy/upload-preview";

export const App = () => (
     <Uploady destination={{ url: "my-server.com/upload" }}>     
        <UploadPreview
            fallbackUrl="https://icon-library.net/images/image-placeholder-icon/image-placeholder-icon-6.jpg"/>
    </Uploady>
);
```

## Advanced Usage

The props _rememberPreviousBatches_, _previewMethodsRef_, and _onPreviewsChanged_ make it possible to do more with previews.
Specifically, the make it possible to create a visual queue of the uploads.

This is especially useful when adding other features such as abort and [retry](../core/retry-hooks).   

The code below shows how to clear the previews with a button click:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import Uploady, { useAbortItem } from "@rpldy/uploady";
import UploadPreview from "@rpldy/upload-preview";
import UploadButton from "@rpldy/upload-button";

const PreviewsWithClear = () => {
	const abortItem = useAbortItem();
	const previewMethodsRef = useRef();
	const [previews, setPreviews] = useState([]);

	const onPreviewsChanged = useCallback((previews) => {
		setPreviews(previews);
	}, []);

	const onClear = useCallback(() => {
		if (previewMethodsRef.current?.clear) {
			previewMethodsRef.current.clear();
		}
	}, [previewMethodsRef]);

	const onRemoveItem = useCallback(() => {
		if (previewMethodsRef.current?.removePreview) {
			abortItem("item-123"); //cancel the upload for the item
            previewMethodsRef.current.removePreview("item-123") //need the item id to remove the preview
        }
    }, [previewMethodsRef]);
	
	return <>
		<button onClick={onClear}>
            Clear {previews.length} previews
        </button>
		<br/>		
        <UploadPreview
            rememberPreviousBatches            
            previewMethodsRef={previewMethodsRef}
            onPreviewsChanged={onPreviewsChanged}
        />            		
	</>;
};

export const App = () => {	
	return <Uploady destination={{ url: "my-server.com/upload" }}>
		<UploadButton />
		<PreviewsWithClear />
	</Uploady>;
};
```

### previewMethodsRef

```typescript
type PreviewMethods = {
    clear: () => void;
    removePreview: (id: string) => void;
};
```

Provides access to preview related methods:

- `clear` - will reset all items shown in the preview
- `removePreview` - will remove a single item preview

> These methods do not remove the item from the upload queue. ONLY from the preview.


### Custom Preview Component

The Upload Preview can be customized in several ways. The main method is through the _PreviewComponent_ prop.
Passing a custom component will make the preview render your own UI per each file being uploaded.

The custom component is called with the following props

```typescript
type PreviewProps = {
	id: string;
	url: string;
	name: string;
	type: PreviewType;
	isFallback: boolean;
    removePreview: () => void;
};
```

For an example of using a custom preview component see [this story](https://react-uploady-storybook.netlify.app/?path=/story/upload-preview--with-progress). 

### Custom Batch Items Method

The default way the UploadPreview component learns which items to show previews for is done by internally using the [useBatchStartListener](../uploady/README.md#usebatchstartlistener-event-hook) hook.
This means that for a batch that hasn't started uploading, because a previous batch hasn't finished or when `autoUpload = false`, the previews for the next batch will not be shown.

If there's a different event (or one completely custom) you want to listen to, for example: the [useBatchAddListener](../uploady/README.md#usebatchaddlistener-event-hook) hook, you can do that with `getUploadPreviewForBatchItemsMethod`.
With useBatchAddListener, the previews will be shown even for batches that hadn't started to upload yet.

This method expects a hook method as a parameter that will return a [batch](../../../README.md#batch)(-like) object with a `items` property as an array of [BatchItem](../../../README.md#batchitem)s.
It returns a UploadPreview component that will use the custom hook method to learn about the items to preview.

Below is an example of how to use it:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import Uploady, { useBatchAddListener } from "@rpldy/uploady";
import { getUploadPreviewForBatchItemsMethod } from "@rpldy/upload-preview";
import UploadButton from "@rpldy/upload-button";

const MyUploadPreview = getUploadPreviewForBatchItemsMethod(useBatchAddListener);

export const App = () => {
    return (
        <Uploady
            destination={{ url: "[upload-url]" }}
        >
            <div className="App">
                <UploadButton>Upload Files</UploadButton>
                <br />
  
                <MyUploadPreview
                    maxPreviewVideoSize={2}
                    fallbackUrl="https://icon-library.net/images/image-placeholder-icon/image-placeholder-icon-6.jpg"
                />
            </div>
        </Uploady>
    );
}

```

### Custom Previews Render

The UploadPreview component allows for a lot of customization by providing your own component to render each single preview.
This is mostly enough since it doesn't render anything else beyond the preview items - no surrounding element/component.

However, in case you wish even more control, you can create your own hook from the batch method you wish to use 
(typically either `useBatchAddListener` or `useBatchStartListener`).

```jsx
import { useBatchAddListener } from "@rpldy/uploady";
import { getPreviewsLoaderHook } from "@rpldy/upload-preview";

const useBatchAddPreviewsData = getPreviewsLoaderHook(useBatchAddListener);

const PreviewDataCustomerViewer = () => {
    const { previews } = useBatchAddPreviewsData({ rememberPreviousBatches: true });

    return previews.map((p: PreviewItem) =>
        <div key={p.id}>
            {p.name}
            <img src={p.url}/>
        </div>);
};
```

The hook receives [PreviewOptions](src/types.js#L46) and can also be called without any param.
