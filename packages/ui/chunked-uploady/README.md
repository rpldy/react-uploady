# Chunked Uploady

This package is provided as a convenient alternative to the main [Uploady](https://react-uploady.org/docs/api/) package. 
To be used in case chunked upload is required.

The server that is accepting the upload must also support chunked uploads. 
The original file is broken down into smaller blobs, which are sent in different requests. 
Each request is sent with the _Content-Range_ header to specify the bytes range.

Internally, _ChunkedUploady_ uses [@rpldy/chunked-sender](https://react-uploady.org/docs/api/senders/chunkedSender/) instead of the default sender.

_Chunked-Sender_, doesn't support grouped uploads (see Upload Options [documentation](https://react-uploady.org/docs/api/#props)) or URL uploading. 
These will be handed over to the default [@rpldy/sender](https://react-uploady.org/docs/api/senders/xhrSender/).

In case the browser doesn't support chunking (blob slicing), the default sender will be used as well.

**The best place to get started is at our: [React-Uploady Documentation Website](https://react-uploady.org)**

## Hooks

Chunked Uploady provides hooks for chunk life-time events:

### useChunkStartListener 

Called when a chunk is about to be sent to the server

> This event is _[cancellable](https://react-uploady.org/docs/api/events/#cancellable-events)_

```javascript
import { useChunkStartListener } from "@rpldy/chunked-uploady";

const MyComponent = () => {
    useChunkStartListener((data) => {
        return {
            url: `${data.url}/${data.chunk.index}`
        };  
    });   
};
```

### useChunkFinishListener

Called when a chunk has finished uploading

## Example

```javascript
import { useChunkFinishListener } from "@rpldy/chunked-uploady";

const MyComponent = () => {
    useChunkFinishListener(({ chunk }) => {
        console.log(`Chunk Finished - ${chunk.id} - attempt: ${chunk.attempt}`);
    });
};
 ```
