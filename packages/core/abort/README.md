# Abort

Adds the capability to abort/cancel running & pending uploads

This is an internal package the uploader consumes.

Abort exposes an UploaderEnhancer that adds the abort methods to the Uploader Options.

**The best place to get started is at our: [React-Uploady Documentation Website](https://react-uploady.org)**

## Installation

```shell
#Yarn:
  $ yarn add @rpldy/abort

#NPM:
  $ npm i @rpldy/abort
```

## Normal vs. Fast Abort

When the number of pending/active uploads is less than the configured threshold (fastAbortThreshold param) or when the threshold is turned off (equals 0), _normal_ abort flow will be used.

In case the threshold is configured and the item count is equal or larger, the _fast_ abort flow will be used.

For All Abort, the threshold is compared against the total number of pending/active items
For Batch Abort, the threshold is compared against the number of pending/active items in the batch. 

In both cases, finished items are ignored in the comparison.

### Normal

**Normal** flow means that every item whether its already uploading or still pending will be individually aborted and an "ITEM_ABORT" event will be fired. 
For abort all, "BATCH_ABORT" event will also be fired respectively. 


### Fast

**Fast** flow means that only active uploads are cancelled (typically very few as concurrent count is set to 1 by default). 

Pending items are ignored and are simply removed from the queue by the uploader. 
For abort all, "BATCH_ABORT" events will not be fired and no "ITEM_ABORT" event will be fired for pending items.
