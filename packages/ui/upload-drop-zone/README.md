# Upload Drop Zone

Drop zone (container) component to initiate file and folder content uploads
Supports individual files as well as recursively iterating over a dropped directory to upload its contents.
 
Uses [html-dir-content](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-dir-content) to process the files/directories in the dnd events ([DataTransferItem](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransferItem)). 

Can easily be combined with other D&D solutions. 

Drop Zones can use different configuration overrides that supersede the options passed to the parent Uploady. 

> Note: Some options cannot be overriden by the button. For example, any prop that influences the file input directly (such as '_multiple_')

**The best place to get started is at our: [React-Uploady Documentation Website](https://react-uploady.org)**

## Installation

```shell
#Yarn: 
   $ yarn add @rpldy/uploady @rpldy/upload-drop-zone 

#NPM:
   $ npm i @rpldy/uploady @rpldy/upload-drop-zone 
```

| onDragOverClassName  | string                                         | undefined                                | class name to add to the container when dragged over                                                     |
| dropHandler          | [DropHandlerMethod](src/types.js#L4)           | undefined                                | override default handler that returns the drop result (ex: files). May return a promise                  | 
| htmlDirContentParams | Object                                         | undefined                                | will be passed as is to html-dir-content. See [docs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-dir-content#api) |
| shouldRemoveDragOver | [ShouldRemoveDragOverMethod](src/types.js#L6)  | undefined                                | callback to help identify when to remove the onDragOverClassName. Receives the dragleave event           |

In addition, most [UploadOptions](../../core/shared/src/types.js#L104) props can be passed to UploadDropZone.
In order to override configuration passed to the parent Uploady component. 
See [Uploady documentation](../uploady#props) for detailed list of upload options.

### shouldHandleDrag

Can be a boolean or a method returning a boolean. In case of a method, the drag event will be provided as a param.

In case shouldHandleDrag === false, the drag&drop flow will not be handled by this component. 
In case you want to enable logic to determine whether drag&drop will be enabled, pass a callback for this prop. 
Returning a _Falsy_ value will disable DnD, returning _Truthy_ will keep it enabled. 

### dropHandler

By default, handles Drop event by calling [getFilesFromDragEvent](https://github.com/yoavniran/html-dir-content/blob/master/README.MD#getfilesfromdragevent) from [html-dir-content](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-dir-content).

In case you want to provide your own logic that will calculate the items(files) passed to the uploader from the drop event, pass in a custom handler.

You can still get the files as the internal method does, by calling _getFiles_ passed to the custom dropHandler as the second param. 

### shouldRemoveDragOver

Gives more control over when to recognize drag-over is done and indicator should be cleared 

See [further explanation on our doc site](https://react-uploady.org/docs/api/components/uploadDropZone/#shouldRemoveDragOver)

## Example

Simple example, shows how upload options can be passed to the drop-zone (grouped, maxGroupSize).

```javascript

import Uploady from "@rpldy/uploady";
import UploadDropZone from "@rpldy/upload-drop-zone";

const App = () => (
    <Uploady destination={destination}>
        <UploadDropZone onDragOverClassName="drag-over"
                        grouped
                        maxGroupSize={3}
        >
            <span>Drag&Drop File(s) Here</span>            
        </UploadDropZone>
    </Uploady>);
```
